 People have been predicting the end since the beginning! Here is a script to remind you of all
 the times the world was supposed to end, but didn't. It's a great way to stay optimistic about
 the future of our species!

 Currently, the script only prints out information to the console, but I plan to incorporate
 the Twitters API to tweet out the information on a daily basis. You know, to keep the
 optimisim going.
